# SavC-MiniDockerProject

## Overview of the Project

**Goal:** Docker is a great way to run applications independently of your OS, plus the Docker Hub stores thousands of images to pull from using the dimple `docker run` command. However, Docker Compose facilitates simultaneous use of two or more Docker containers, allowing for interaction between them. The configuration is specified in a YAML file that can be customized to one's use case. This mini-project aims to practice creating the files necessary to use Docker Compose.
